-- Enhancements:
-- Custom Signs: This example configures custom signs for various git changes (e.g., added, modified, and deleted lines) to make them more visually distinctive or to match personal preferences.
-- Line Highlights and Number Highlights: Demonstrates how to toggle line and number highlighting for changes. Set numhl and linehl to true if you prefer these highlights.
-- Keymaps Configuration: Provides a placeholder for customizing keymaps. You can define your own shortcuts for navigating and interacting with git hunks.
-- Git Directory Watching: Adjusts the interval for watching the git directory for changes and enables file tracking.
-- Current Line Blame: Enables inline git blame information showing the author, date, and commit summary for the current line, with customization options for the display format and delay before showing.
